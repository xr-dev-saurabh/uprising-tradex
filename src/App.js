//Steps for route
//1. Landing Page has all the above components. Navbar has two components, Navbar and ModelHam, add link for route in both.
// On clicking on Contact button on navbar, it should take the user to footer section with smooth scroll like in ProductHero component.
//2. Second is About page which has First, Second and ThirdSection in about folder, it should have footer and should re-direct to footer on onclick Contact button.
//Footer must be in all pages and navbar in all pages.
//3. Third is Product page which has ProductHero and ProductRow with footer. Add this to Order button on navbar and Modalham
